Hello! I am a PhD student in the CSE department at UC San Diego in the [machine learning](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/research/faculty-research-areas/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/) and [theory](https://cstheory.ucsd.edu/home.html) groups. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Mikhail Belkin](http://misha.belkin-wang.org/). Prior to my PhD, I completed an MS in computer science at Columbia University, where I researched under the excellent mentorship of Professor [Alexandr Andoni](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~andoni/).

I was previously a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind working on feature learning and an ML Research intern at Goldman Sachs. I am supported by the [ARCS Foundation Fellowship](https://san-diego.arcsfoundation.org).

Broadly, I am excited about developing conceptually-driven machine learning and algorithmic methods. I am especially interested in:

1. Feature/representation learning 
2. Deep learning (theory + applications)
3. Steering and monitoring LLMs
4. Tabular/scientific data

Feel free to reach out via email: `dbeaglehole@ucsd.edu`.
